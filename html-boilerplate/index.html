    <h1>HTML Basics</h1>
    <p>HTML seems less like a coding language and more like a text editor, where you can <em>emphasise</em> certian words or <strong>actions</strong> using tags. 
        This is called <strong>nesting</strong> and creates a parent child relationship. Another thing to note is any spaces above one are ignored. 
        This makes it possible to format HTML code and become more readable.</p> 
        <!-- This is a comment! I'll probably never use these...-->
    <ul>
        <li>Unordered</li>
        <li>List</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Ordered (1)</li>
        <li>List (2)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's like a more indepth and verbose version of word in that sense. Looking at the text alone without java script I can actually see why old websites looked the way they did</p>
    <h3>The formatting looks almost archaic.</h3>
