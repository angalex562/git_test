    <h1>Homepage</h1>

    <p> Here we can see how tags really work. Using the 'a' tag you can add a "value" to the "reference" hypertext reference which is simply a link in this case 
        but it could be anything from a PDF, image or video. The target reference says where to open the new document and "noopener noreferrer" prevents the link from 
        connecting to the website and vise versa for security. </p>  

    <p> <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About The Odin Project</a> 
        This is an absolute link because it contains the protocol and domain. Relative links instead connect to another file within the website itself such as this
        <a href="./pages/about.html">About Link</a> </p>
